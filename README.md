# Travelling-Salesman
This code represents a problem i was faced with as a final assignment in a module in my 2nd year. We had to code a solution to a plane visiting 100 different co-ordinates whilst following certain restrictions, the quicker the solution was in terms of hours the better. i used 2 text files filled with co-ordinates, 1 for latitude and the other for longitude. I imported these files into my code using its own class.
